# VARIABLES

* Variables are used to store data;they are placeholders for concrete values.

* Using a variable requires the following steps:
(i) Declare the variables.
(ii) Initialise it i.e. give it a value.

* To declare a variable,you will use the **var** statement like var a; var thisIsVariable; etc.

* For the names of the variables, you can use any combination of **letters**, **numbers**, **underscore** characters, and the **dollar** sign.

* Whereas you cannot start with a **number** like 2a; 5x; etc.

* Initialisation: means giving it value for the first time:
=> Declare the variable first, then initialise it.
=> Declare and initialise with a single statement.

* Variables are **case-sensitive**

* **Undefined:** Trying to console a variable who's value is not assigned.
Example: var x;
        console.log(x)    //undefined

* **Not-defined:** Trying to console a variable which is not declared.
Example: console.log(x)   //not-defined
