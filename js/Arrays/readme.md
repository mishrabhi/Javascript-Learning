# ARRAY 

* What is an array? It's simply a **list** (a sequence) of values. Instead of using one variable to
store one value, you can use one array variable to store any number of values as elements of the
array.

* To define an array that has three elements, you can write the following line of code:

 `var a = [1, 2, 3];`
