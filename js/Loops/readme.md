# LOOPS

* In JavaScript, the following are the four types of loops:

1. while loops

2. do-while loops

3. for loops

### While LOOPS:

* The while loops are the simplest type of iteration. They look like the following:

var i = 0;

while (i < 10) {

i++;

}

* The while statement is followed by a condition in parentheses and a code block in curly brackets. As long as the condition evaluates to true, the code block is executed over and over again.


### Do-While LOOPS:

* The do...while loops are a slight variation of while loops. 

var i = 0;

do {

i++;

} while (i < 10);

* Here, the do statement is followed by a code block and a condition after the block. This means that the code block is always executed, **at least once**, before the condition is evaluated.


### FOR LOOP:

* **Initialisation:**
This is the code that is executed before you even enter the loop.

* **Increment:** This is the code that is executed after every iteration.

* In the initialization part, you can define a variable (or set the initial value of an existing
variable), most often called i

* In the condition part, you can compare i to a boundary value, such as i < 100

* In the increment part, you can increase i by 1, such as i++
