# LOOPS:

* Loops allow you to perform repetitive operations with less code.

* In JavaScript, the following are the four types of loops:

1. while loops

2. do-while loops

3. for loops

### While LOOP:

* The while statement is followed by a condition in parentheses and a code block in curly
brackets. As long as the condition evaluates to true, the code block is executed over and over
again.


var i = 0;

while (i < 10) {

i++;   //increment/decrement

}


### Do While LOOP:

* The do...while loops are a slight variation of while loops.

var i = 0;

do {

i++;

} while (i < 10);

* Here, the do statement is followed by a code block and a condition after the block. This means
that the code block is always executed, at least once, before the condition is evaluated.


### For LOOP:

* Syntax:

for(inititalisation; condition; increment/decrement)

      {
          body
           }


* In the initialization part, you can define a variable (or set the initial value of an existing
variable), most often called i.

* In the condition part, you can compare i to a boundary value, such as i < 100

* In the increment part, you can increase i by 1, such as i++
